# Bike-Sale-Dashboard- Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Using MS-EXCEL)

### PROJECT OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to analyze customer data to understand the key factors influencing bike purchases.
By visualizing demographics such as age, gender, income, marital status, education, occupation, and commute distance,
the dashboard aims to help businesses identify potential customers, track sales trends, and make data-driven marketing decisions to boost bike sales.

3. How does education level affect the likelihood of purchasing a bike?
4. Is there any relationship between the number of children and bike ownership?
5. Which occupation group (e.g., Management, Clerical, Manual) purchases the most bikes?
6. How does commute distance impact the decision to buy a bike?
7. Which age group (Young, Middle Age, Old) is most likely to purchase a bike?
8. Is there a significant difference in average income between those who purchased and those who didn’t?
9. What is the trend of bike purchases across different age ranges (e.g., 30–60 years)?

## PROCESS

Collect and Clean Data – Gather the bike sales dataset and remove duplicates or errors.
Prepare Data – Organize fields, create age and commute categories, and format all values.
Analyze Data – Use Pivot Tables to calculate averages and counts (e.g., income by purchase, age vs purchase).
Design Dashboard – Add Pivot Charts (bar, line, column) to visualize key insights clearly.
Add Interactivity – Insert slicers for filters like Marital Status, Education, Children, and Occupation.
Format and Finalize – Apply a theme, title, and proper labels to make the dashboard professional and easy to read.

## PROJECT INSIGHT

Middle-aged customers are more likely to purchase bikes compared to younger or older groups.
Married individuals and those with higher income levels show a greater tendency to buy bikes.
Customers with shorter commute distances are more interested in purchasing bikes.
Manaement and professional occupations have a higher purchase rate than manual or clerical jobs.
Education level also plays a role — customers with graduate or bachelor’s degrees are more likely to buy.

## FINAL CONCLUSION

The Bike Sales Dashboard provides a clear understanding of customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
It helps identify the target audience for marketing — primarily middle-aged, married professionals with higher income and shorter commutes.
This analysis can assist businesses in improving sales strategies, pricing models, and promotional campaigns to attract potential buyers effectively.
